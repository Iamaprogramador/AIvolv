<p>This program was written in Python, using python3.9.2.</p>
<p>It is a simulation of a large amount of "agents" moving around.<br>
An agent can be on one of three teams: red, green, or blue.</p>
<p>Each agent has a small neural network brain that gradually changes<br>
over time. Currently no natural selection has been implemented, so no<br>
complex behavior ever emerges.</p>
<p>The program keeps track of the locations of all of the agents<br>
and creates a video of the behavior of the agents over time.</p>
<p>Look over the code to see how it works, I hope you like it!<br>
